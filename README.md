# Plan2Go

Plan2Go is an open source calender software made for the YH4F 2023. It is fully customizable and with many features. The front-end has been done with HTML and CSS, and the calender and customizations are made using JavaScript. Even though this is an really basic project I wanted to make this to improve my own coding skills.

# How2Open

Opening our calendar is easy since it is written in 'website' language.

You have got multiple options:
- Open the gitlab pages website (recommended): https://thedutchprogrammers.edugit.io/plan2go/
- Host the website yourself: just clone this repo: `git clone https://edugit.org/thedutchprogrammers/plan2go.git` and then make the webserver use a folder `/plan2go/` which points to the `public` folder in the files. (Or if you are smart, you can actually edit the `public/manifest.json` and then host it under a different folder, but you still have to point to the `public/` folder and not to the cloned folder)
- Or you can try our Desktop App builds that are made possible using Tauri. You can find the releases on the Github repo's releases page: https://github.com/TheDutchProgrammers/Plan2Go/releases/


# How2Use
Using our calender is really easy. You add an event to your personal calender and you can see it appear on there. You can also export the calender to your favorite mobile calender.
