# Plan2Go

Plan2Go is an open source calender software made for the YH4F 2023. It is fully customizable and with many features. The front-end has been done with HTML and CSS, and the calender and customizations are made using JavaScript. Even though this is an really basic project I wanted to make this to improve my own coding skills.

# How2Use
Using our calander is really easy. You add an event to your personal calander and you can see it appear on there. You can also export the calender to your favorite mobile calander.

# Quick Note
When hosting the `public/` folder as a website and you don't place it under the `/plan2go/` folder in your webserver, make sure to edit the `public/manifest.json` file to match up with YOUR webserver folder location. (This is needed for the PWA)
